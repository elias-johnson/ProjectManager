# ProjectManager
Currently in progress!
CLI for accessing and managing your projects.
This script is written using Batch, a Windows text file that runs a series of commands similar to what you may use on CMD.
This script will only work for Windows. It will be designed to work on Windows 11, so I'm unsure of the compatability with older Windows versions yet.

To download the Batch file, click on the raw file link and save as a .bat: [Raw File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elias-johnson/ProjectManager/refs/heads/main/.ProjectManager.bat)

Download the file to an easily accessible location on your machine (such as C:\Users\yourusername\).

Currently, this project can only manage files inside a project directory (no directory trees).
