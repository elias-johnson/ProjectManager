# ProjectManager
Simple Windows CLI for accessing and managing your projects.

This script is written in Windows Batch. It runs on Windows 11, but there may be compatability issues with older versions of Windows.

This project is really just the start to something more advanced that I would like to do later, so it's still very bare-boned.
Currently, this script can make new project directories and files within that directory, but no directory trees.

I'll be honest, there isn't currently much of a benefit to using this script over just managing your projects yourself via command-line.
It basically does the same thing - but it has a 'fancy' header. :)
